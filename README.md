# Mile-End-Yummy-dataset-Project
Mini Project for ECS7020P module.

In this project, the yummy dataset provided by ECS7020P students has been used, and it consists of two parts where each tackles a different problem. 

A picture of the model with rice or chips will be given in the basic problem. The model developed in this project should be able to classify this image correctly, and in the advanced problem it was predicted whether a dish is Italian, American, or Chinese based on the ingredients used in it.
